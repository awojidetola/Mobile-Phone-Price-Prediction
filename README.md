# Mobile-Phone-Price-Prediction
In this project, the price ranges of mobile phones are predicted based on the features the phone possesses. The price ranges are: 

+ Low Cost
+ Medium Cost
+ High Cost 
+ Very High Cost

The data used for this project was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification). 

It was deployed to Streamlit as a web application here: https://awojidetola-mobile-phone-price-prediction-prediction-mma8kw.streamlitapp.com
